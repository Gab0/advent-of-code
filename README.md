### About

Here are solutions to [Advent of Code]( https://adventofcode.com/)
challenges using the `Haskell` programming language.

The original idea is to check 
if `Haskell` has an edge in competitive programming
over `Python` or `C`. `Haskell` provides nice function composition and
nice parsing libraries, so let's check how it goes. Up to this point I still think completing the challenges using `Python` is easier, with 
much shorter "development time".



The progress will be very slow I guess... in a few years
the stars for all AoC editions may be here.

### Run

To run the first challenge of 2021:
 ```
cd Puzzle
bash run 202101
```

If `ghc` asks for missing modules, install them with `stack install <module>`.
